Q1.In which lifecycle method do you save the app state to shared preferences?
A:onPause()

Q2.In which lifecycle method do you restore the app state?
A:onCreate()

Can you think of a case where it makes sense to have both shared preferences and instance state?
A:
saveInstanceState - when frequently moving back and forth between activities
SharedPreferences - when information for long time.
you can use both if you need to frequently update data to view and to local storage.
